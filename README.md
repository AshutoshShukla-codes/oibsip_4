<h5>Model</h5>
<p>Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm (MNB) is a probabilistic learning method that is mostly used in Natural Language Processing (NLP).</p>
<p>I have choosen MNB model as its precision is better and in this type of problem precision matters more than accuracy</p>
<p>Precision : 1.0</p>
<p>Confusion Matrix :  [[896   0]
                        [ 42  96]]</p>
<p>Accuracy : 0.9593810444874274</p>
