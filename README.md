<h1>Model :</h1>
<p><b>Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm (MNB)</b> is a probabilistic learning method that is mostly used in Natural Language Processing (NLP).</p>
<p> The MNB algorithm works on Bayes Theorem, which calculates the probability of an event occurring based on the prior knowledge of conditions related to an event :</p> <p>P(A|B) = P(A) * P(B|A)/P(B)</p>
<p>I have choosen the </b>MNB algorithm</b> as its precision is better and in this type of problem precision matters more than accuracy</p>
<p>Precision : 1.0</p>
<p>Confusion Matrix :  [[896   0]
                        [ 42  96]]</p>
<p>Accuracy : 0.9593810444874274</p>
